```{r}
#Filter GOTSTAMPFAM to only include those who answered "Yes" Filter for those only who received SNAP benefits

#GOTSTAMPFAM Codes: 10 = NO, 21 = Yes in last calendar year, 22 = Yes in last month.
#This will remove all observations where GOTSTAMPFAM does not equal 21 or 22
nhis_data<-nhis_data %>%
  filter(GOTSTAMPFAM==21 | GOTSTAMPFAM==22)

```{r}
#Convert FSRAWSCORE into a categorical variable, called FoodSecurity, with 3 levels: Secure (0-2), Low Food Security(3-5), Very Low Food Security (6-10). 

#FSRAWSCORE Codes:

#METRO Codes: 010 = MSA In Central City, 020 = MSM Not in Central City. All else are non-urban locations.

#---------- WRANGLE CONFOUNDING VARIABLES -------------

#REGION: a categorical variable with string labels as values.

#AGE: A numerical variable indicating age of the individual surveyed.

#EDUC: Create a categorical variable EDUCATION, with three levels. Did not graduate high school (0), high school graduate or GED (1), vocational degree (2), bachelor's degree/higher (3).
nhis_data<-nhis_data %>%
  mutate(EDUCATION=if_else(EDUC %in% c(500, 601, 602, 603), 3, #bachelor's or higher
                           if_else(EDUC %in% c(402, 403), 2, #vocational degree
                                   if_else(EDUC %in% c(301, 302, 401), 1, 0)))) #high school or GED. Includes college drop outs.
                                  #else, set to 0 (did not complete high school)
  



#RACE: Has been set to labels. Filter out those who chose not to answer race.
nhis_data<-nhis_data %>%
  filter(RACE != "Unknown-refused" | RACE != "Unknown-not ascertained" | RACE != "Unknown-don't know") %>%
  
  
  #INCOME: How to handle? discuss in class to decide levels.
  
  
  #HEALTH: Make into a binary inducator variable Health_Issues, which has a value of (0) if the individual is healthy (Code 1-3), and a value of (1) if the individual has fair to poor health (Code 4-5). Give a patch fix value of (2) to all other values for now.
  mutate(Health_Issues=if_else(HEALTH %in% c(1,2,3), 0, #0 for healthy
                               if_else(HEALTH %in% c(4,5), 1, 2))) #1 for poor health, 2 for all else 
  
  #NCHILD: already contains total number of children. Cap at 9 total.
  
  #FAMOLDNO: number of persons in the household aged 65 or older. Data collection cap at 5 total.
  
  #NUMPREC: number of individuals in the household total. "A 3 digit numeric value".
