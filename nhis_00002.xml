      <txt><![CDATA[METRO reports whether the household was located inside or outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Households inside an MSA are further classified by whether they were located in the central city of the MSA. Households outside an MSA are further classified by farm or nonfarm status.

Information on whether the household was located within an MSA was added by the National Center for Health Statistics, not collected from respondents. 

In the original NHIS public use files, for 1982 forward, information about whether a non-MSA household was classified as "Nonfarm" or "Farm" was included in the same variable that reported location inside or outside a central city for MSA households. Prior to 1982, these two pieces of information were in two different variables in the original public use files. In IPUMS NHIS, for years prior to 1982, the information was all included in a single variable via supplemental programming to increase comparability over time.

Definition of MSA

The "NCHS Definitions" section of the National Center for Health Statistics website provides the following information about classifications for place of residence for the survey:

"MSA's are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The MSA standards are revised before each decennial Census. When Census data become available, the standards are applied to define the actual MSA's. An MSA is a county or group of contiguous counties that contains at least one city with a population of 50,000 or more or includes a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area of at least 50,000 with a metropolitan population of at least 100,000. In addition to the county containing the main city or urbanized area, an MSA may contain other counties that are metropolitan in character and are economically and socially integrated with the central counties. In New England, cities and towns, rather than counties, are used to define MSA's. For data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) prior to 1995, metropolitan population is defined by OMB in 1983 using the 1980 census. Starting with the 1995 NHIS, metropolitan population is based on MSA's as defined by OMB in 1993 using the 1990 Census."

The NCHS Definitions webpage further notes that "the largest city in an MSA is always a central city." Households coded as "MSA, not in Central City" are located in any part of an MSA that is not part of the central city itself. Households coded as "Not in MSA" are in all other places in the country except MSA's.


Definition of Farm

Only households in areas that were classified as "rural" were at risk of being classified as farms. For 1969-1981, a rural household was classified as a farm if: 1) it was located on 10+ acres that yielded $50+ from the sale of crops, livestock, and other farm products; or, 2) it was located on less than 10 acres that yielded $250+ from the sale of crops, livestock, and other farm products. Beginning in 1982, a farm was any rural household that yielded $1,000+ from the sale of crops, livestock, and other farm products. These definitions of a farm basically matched those adopted in the 1960 and 1970 censuses and in the 1980-2000 censuses, respectively. Survey respondents supplied the information whether the size of the place that the household owned or rented was 10 or more acres (for 1969-1981) and about whether the sale of farm products during the past 12 months reached a specified threshold ($50, $250, or $1000).

Non-interview households are those in which the dwelling was unoccupied or in which the residents were either absent or refused to participate in the survey.

This weight should be used for many analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the section of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, 
race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 


Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.

Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, INCFAM07ON provides total grouped family income using an income bracket methodology introduced in 2007. Responses are reported in nominal dollars and have not been adjusted for inflation.


Starting with the 2007 NHIS, the income amount follow-up questions that had been in place since 1997 were replaced with a series of unfolding bracket questions. The unfolding bracket method asked a series of closed-ended income range questions (e.g., "Is it less than $50,000?") if the respondent did not provide an answer to the exact income amount question. The closed-ended income range questions were constructed so that each successive question establishes a smaller range for the amount of the family's income.

      <txt><![CDATA[For family reference persons from 1990 to 1996 and all persons from 1997 forward, GOTSTAMPFAM indicates if ANY family member(s) in the person's family was authorized to receive food stamps or SNAP benefits at any time during the month prior to the interview (in the 1990-1996 samples) or during the previous calendar year (from 1997 forward). 

From 1993 to 1996, the universe only included family reference persons who are not from single-person or married-couple only families with an annual income above $20,000.

In 1993, this question was only asked of persons who were interviewed in quarters 3 and 4.


From 1990 to 1996, GOTSTAMPFAM is part of the Family Resources supplement that provides information on individuals' health benefits, amount of coverage and income received from employment, welfare benefits, public assistance, and savings. Starting in 1997, this variable is part of the family file questionnaires. 

Questions in the Family Resources supplement are different from those in the family life questionnaires in terms of the content and the treatment of missing data. Missing data in the Family Resources supplement were imputed and users can refer to the imputation flag variables to identify persons with imputed data. 

Please refer to  GOTSTMPFAMFL to identify persons in families whose data on food stamp receipt was imputed.


From 1997 to 2010, the term "food stamps" was defined as including "a food stamp card or voucher, or cash grants from the state for food." Beginning in 2011, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program replaced food stamps.

Data users interested in whether a particular person was eligible for food stamp benefits may wish to use variable GOTSTAMP, which indicates whether the specific person was authorized to receive food stamps during the past year. GOTSTAMP is only available from 1997 to 2010 and was discontinued with the introduction of the SNAP program. NHIS cautions GOTSTAMP "may have limited analytic value at the person level since food stamp authorization is based on a family's economic circumstances."]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[FSRAWSCORE reports family's raw score on the 30-day food security scale. It ranges from 0-10 and reflects the number of affirmative responses to the ten food insecurity questions that correspond with the following variables:  FSRUNOUT,  FSNOTLAST,
 FSBALANC, FSSKIP,  FSSKIPNO,  FSATELESS,
 FSHUNGRY,  FSWEIGHT,  FSNOTEAT, and  FSNOTEATNO. 

For more information on how affirmative responses were determined, please select more. Please see the comparability tab for details on possible changes in comparability over time.


Although FSSKIPNO and FSNOEATNO are continuous variables, a response is considered affirmative if number of days ranges from 1-30. For the other 8 variables, responses including "often true," "sometimes true," and "yes" are considered affirmative. 

The purpose of the Food Security supplement in the Family Questionnaire is to assess whether the individual's family has been able to afford adequate food for all adults during the previous 30 days. These questions are sponsored by the Economic Research Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
